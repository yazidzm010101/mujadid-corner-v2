Hello guys, in this post, I&#x27;m going to share my experience installing Flutter on Linux. Flutter itself is a widget/component-based framework and is cross-platform, supporting Android, iOS, and web, using the same codebase. This method should be applicable no matter what distribution you use. In this case, the distribution I&#x27;m using is Garuda Linux, which is based on Arch. Okay, without further ado, here is the step-by-step installation of Flutter on Linux.

## Install Android Studio

The first step I took was to install Android Studio, the purpose being to utilize the GUI-based SDK manager that is well-integrated within Android Studio. Because in Garuda Linux, I found it troublesome to maintain the Android SDK through the distribution&#x27;s package manager (Pacman) to tweak permissions and environment paths. With Android Studio, issues like these should no longer exist.

![Installing Android Studio](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/mujadid-corner.appspot.com/o/storyboard_images%2Finstalling_flutter_Screenshot_20231101_224815.png?alt=media)

## Android Studio &amp; SDK Manager

Okay, moving on after installing Android Studio, let&#x27;s proceed to accept all the license agreements from Android Studio itself and simultaneously install the Android SDK through Android Studio. After it&#x27;s done, don&#x27;t close it yet; open the &#x27;More SDK Manager&#x27;. Here, we&#x27;ll check the emulator and the Android command line tools. Additionally, this step is optional, but we can also install a virtual disk to be run later through the emulator, or alternatively, prepare a native Android device to be used as a test subject through ADB.

![open SDK](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/mujadid-corner.appspot.com/o/storyboard_images%2Finstalling_flutter_Screenshot_20231101_225503.png?alt=media)

## Downloading Flutter

![download flutter](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/mujadid-corner.appspot.com/o/storyboard_images%2Finstalling_flutter_Screenshot_20231101_225914.png?alt=media)

To download the flutter, we can access [this page](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/linux) to get a complete guide and get the tarball file of installation, but I will help explain it here. Yup, I don&#x27;t use a package manager to install Flutter because when I checked, Flutter tends to create a cache in its own folder when running certain commands, and for some reason, it always fails to set permissions for Flutter in its base environment path. So for safety, I just downloaded the tarball file in my home directory like this. Next, I just need to extract it in &quot;/home/username/Flutter&quot;.

![extract flutter](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/mujadid-corner.appspot.com/o/storyboard_images%2Finstalling_flutter_Screenshot_20231101_230117.png?alt=media)

## Setting Up Environment Variable

Next, we need to set up the environment variables so that every installed app can run properly. First, the env ANDROID_HOME, then Flutter as well, and lastly, this one is optional, for Flutter web development, by default, it will look for the base path of Google Chrome as its default browser. But you can use other Chromium-based browsers (for example, in my case, Brave Browser) by setting up the environment variables like this. Next, don&#x27;t forget to log in, log out, or restart your Linux so that the environment variables are reloaded.

```sh bash_profile.sh
# ........some previous configuration

# taro ini dipaling bawah
export CHROME_EXECUTABLE=/opt/brave-bin/brave
export ANDROID_HOME=/home/$USER/Android/Sdk
export FLUTTER_HOME=/home/$USER/Flutter/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$FLUTTER_HOME

```

## Running &quot;flutter doctor&quot;

Before moving to the next step, ensure that flutter linceses has been agreed by using this command

```bash
flutter doctor --android-licenses
```

![flutter lincenses](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/mujadid-corner.appspot.com/o/storyboard_images%2Finstalling_flutter_Screenshot_20231101_231418.png?alt=media)
To check if all settings has been configured we can run this command in the terminal

```bash
flutter doctor
```

![flutter doctor](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/mujadid-corner.appspot.com/o/storyboard_images%2Finstalling_flutter_Screenshot_20231101_231454.png?alt=media)

By doing so the terminal will list the dependencies/requirements fulfilled by Flutter. If there are any that appear in red, perhaps something was missed during the setup of Flutter and Android Studio.

## Opsional - Visual Studio Code Extension

This is optional, but I prefer using Visual Studio Code for Flutter development because it is lighter compared to Android Studio, since I don&#x27;t use XML-based layouts, it&#x27;s more like working with ReactJS component-based structure. So, I prefer using a regular code editor with ADB/emulator.

In the Visual Studio Code marketplace, there is a cool extension that can be installed to transform VS Code into a Flutter IDE. This way, you can run and debug the main.dart file using the code editor and it will detect the available virtual devices installed as well as the running ADB devices. You can check the extension [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.flutter)

There is one component that I still think that could be improved, which is the lockscreen. Even KDE is already beautiful with it's design and blurry effect plus Kvantum theme, I always envy the super-neat design of Gnome desktop. One of the component itself is the lockscreen.\n\n## Let's observe the difference\n\nWe can take a look here, how the lockscreen view differ between Gnome and Plasma.\n\n![Gnome Lockscreen - PopOS 22.04](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/mujadid-corner.appspot.com/o/storyboard_images%2Fcustomize_kde_locskcreen-gnome_lockscreen.gif?alt=media)\n\n\n![KDE Plasma Lockscreen - Fedora KDE 38-1.6](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/mujadid-corner.appspot.com/o/storyboard_images%2Fcustomize_kde_locskcreen-kde_lockscreen.gif?alt=media)\n\nAs we can see, both have two state inside that lockscreen view, the first state only shows a clock waiting user to give any input to shows the second state that displays active user, password input, and some session action. One thing that I really love from Gnome design here is they centered the clock with darken and blurred wallpaper, giving the user-centric vibes, while on the other hands the Plasma design positioned the clock centered-top, which may be okay if it's on my smartphone size, but in the desktop I prefer the Gnome design.\n\n\n## Transforming Plasma lockscreen\n\nNow, after observing the difference, let's dive in to customize our Plasma lockscreen. Here are some notes before we dive in.\n- We neeed Linux with KDE Plasma Desktop Environment (obviously)\n- Just in case, please backup the folders that we will modified here (if you still worry, you can try in VM first)\n- I also store the file comparison in a github repository [here](https://github.com/yazidzm010101/kde-plasma-gnomelike-lockscreen)\n\nNext, the key component is the default breeze theme that located in\n```\n/usr/share/plasma/look-and-feel/org.kde.breeze.desktop/contents\n```\n\nThere were two files from path above, which are\n\n```\n- ./components/WallpaperFader.qml\n- ./locsckreen/LockScreenUi.qml\n```\n\nAll files in that path written in QML, the layouting system for application that built using QT toolkit in KDE Plasma Desktop Enviroment.\n\n## Execution\n\nHonestly, when I first read this directory, I don't actually understand what I do, but after several try and error and some diving process in QML documentation I starting to get the behaviour of this files. My advice is, please backup that folders first before we continue to modify them (Even, as I remember KDE have its fallback lockscreen in case the breeeze theme layout is broken or can't be parsed).\n\n##### LockScreenUi.qml\n\nFirst, when you scrolled down inside LockScreenUi.qml there one component WallpaperFader inside this file\n\n```qml LockScreenUi.qml\nWallpaperFader {\n    anchors.fill: parent\n    state: lockScreenRoot.uiVisible ? \"on\" : \"off\"\n    source: wallpaper\n    mainStack: mainStack\n    footer: footer\n    clock: clock\n}\n```\n\nWe can modify this component so it's receive additional property named mainBlock, where the mainBlock will be the parent component that conaitns mainStack and clock component\n\n```qml LockScreenUi.qml\nWallpaperFader {\n    anchors.fill: parent\n    state: lockScreenRoot.uiVisible ? \"on\" : \"off\"\n    source: wallpaper\n    mainStack: mainStack\n    mainBlock: mainBlock\n    footer: footer\n    clock: clock\n}\n```\n\nNext, scroll again until we find DropShadow component\n\n```qml LockScreenUi.qml\nDropShadow {\n    id: clockShadow\n    anchors.fill: clock\n    source: clock\n    visible: !softwareRendering\n    radius: 6\n    samples: 14\n    spread: 0.3\n    color : \"black\" // shadows should always be black\n    Behavior on opacity {\n        OpacityAnimator {\n            duration: PlasmaCore.Units.veryLongDuration * 2\n            easing.type: Easing.InOutQuad\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTo remove the clock shadow (so we can mimick the gnome layout) we can just comment out the visible property like belows\n\n```qml LockScreenUi.qml\nDropShadow {\n    id: clockShadow\n    anchors.fill: clock\n    source: clock\n    // visible: !softwareRendering\n    visible: false\n    radius: 6\n    samples: 14\n    spread: 0.3\n    color : \"black\" // shadows should always be black\n    Behavior on opacity {\n        OpacityAnimator {\n            duration: PlasmaCore.Units.veryLongDuration * 2\n            easing.type: Easing.InOutQuad\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the same file, scroll again until we found Clock component\n\n```qml LockScreenUi.qml\nClock {\n    id: clock\n    property Item shadow: clockShadow\n    visible: y \u003e 0\n    anchors.horizontalCenter: parent.horizontalCenter\n    y: (mainBlock.userList.y + mainStack.y)/2 - height/2\n    Layout.alignment: Qt.AlignBaseline\n}\n```\n\nThen, we can comment out the y property (position of the clock), because we want to make it position animated between idle state and active state\n\n```qml LockScreenUi.qml\n Clock {\n    id: clock\n    property Item shadow: clockShadow\n    visible: y \u003e 0\n    anchors.horizontalCenter: parent.horizontalCenter\n    // y: (mainBlock.userList.y + mainStack.y)/2 -

height) - 200\n        }\n        PropertyChanges {\n            target: clock\n            scale: 0.5\n        }\n    },\n    // .\n    // .\n    // .\n    // .\n    // di bawah ini ada potongan state dengan name \"off\" harusnya\n]\n```\n\nWith that changes, it actually gives us this behaviour:\n- State \"on\" is when the lockscreen receive interaction from user\n- The shadow from the clock is intentionally commented out, because we want to make it like Gnome that don't have any shadow\n- Now, if the state of the lockscreen is \"on\", we make the opacity the clock from 0, and scale it down to 0.5 from the actual size, giving it a fade-zoom-out animation.\n- The y position was set up by using from the parent height divided by two substracted by the height of its clock and substracted again 200 unit (so it centered from monitor but kind of elevated a bit to the top)\n\nNow, we have to changes the \"off\" state, here is the original version\n\n```qml WallpaperFader.qml\nstates: [\n    // .\n    // .\n    // .\n    // .\n    // di atas ini ada potongan state dengan name \"on\" harusnya\n\n    State {\n        name: \"off\"\n        PropertyChanges {\n            target: mainStack\n            opacity: 0\n        }\n        PropertyChanges {\n            target: footer\n            opacity: 0\n        }\n        PropertyChanges {\n            target: wallpaperFader\n            factor: 0\n        }\n        PropertyChanges {\n            target: clock.shadow\n            opacity: wallpaperFader.alwaysShowClock ? 1 : 0\n        }\n        PropertyChanges {\n            target: clock\n            opacity: wallpaperFader.alwaysShowClock ? 1 : 0\n        }\n    }\n]\n```\n\nNow, this is the modified versoin\n\n```qml WallpaperFader.qml\nstates: [\n    // .\n    // .\n    // .\n    // .\n    // above should be the snippet of the \"on\" state\n\n    State {\n        name: \"off\"\n        PropertyChanges {\n            target: mainStack\n            opacity: 0\n        }\n        PropertyChanges {\n            target: footer\n            opacity: 0\n        }\n        PropertyChanges {\n            target: wallpaperFader\n            factor: 1\n        }\n        // PropertyChanges {\n        //     target: clock.shadow\n        //     opacity: wallpaperFader.alwaysShowClock ? 1 : 0\n        // }\n        PropertyChanges {\n            target: clock\n            opacity: 1\n        }\n        PropertyChanges {\n            target: clock\n            y: (mainBlock.height / 2) - height\n        }\n        PropertyChanges {\n            target: mainBlock\n            y: 200\n        }\n        PropertyChanges {\n            target: mainBlock\n            scale: 0.5\n        }\n    }\n]\n```\n\nAnd after that changes, it should give us this behaviour:\n\n- State \"off\" means the condition when lockscreen is first-time shown and don't receive any interaction from the user.\n- In that state, the clock of the shadow also removed (same as the \"on\" state)\n- The opacity of the clock set to 1, giving its a full opacity\n- Now, the y clock position is set using the half of its mainBlock (parent) minus the clock height, it should make the clock centered horizontally.\n- And for the mainBlock itself:\n    - The position set to 200, so it was below the clock a bit\n    - We scaled down the size to 0.5\n    - And the opacity was set to 0\n    - This should gives it's the animation like the clock when the state is \"on\", but reversed.\n\nLast, but not least, still in the same file , we have to change some script to handle the transition here\n\n```qml WallpaperFader.qml\ntransitions: [\n    Transition {\n        from: \"off\"\n        to: \"on\"\n        //Note: can't use animators as they don't play well with parallelanimations\n        NumberAnimation {\n            targets: [mainStack, footer, clock]\n            property: \"opacity\"\n            duration: PlasmaCore.Units.veryLongDuration\n            easing.type: Easing.InOutQuad\n        }\n    },\n    Transition {\n        from: \"on\"\n        to: \"off\"\n        NumberAnimation {\n            targets: [mainStack, footer, clock]\n            property: \"opacity\"\n            duration: PlasmaCore.Units.veryLongDuration\n            easing.type: Easing.InOutQuad\n        }\n    }\n]\n```\n\nNow, after the modified version\n\n```qml WallpaperFader.qml\ntransitions: [\n    Transition {\n        from: \"off\"\n        to: \"on\"\n        //Note: can't use animators as they don't play well with parallelanimations\n        NumberAnimation {\n            targets: [mainStack, footer, clock, mainBlock]\n            properties: \"opacity,y,scale\"\n            duration: PlasmaCore.Units.veryLongDuration\n            easing.type: Easing.InOutQuad\n        }\n    },\n    Transition {\n        from: \"on\"\n        to: \"off\"\n        NumberAnimation {\n            targets: [mainStack, footer, clock, mainBlock]\n            properties: \"opacity,y,scale\"\n            duration: PlasmaCore.Units.veryLongDuration\n            easing.type: Easing.InOutQuad\n        }\n    }\n]\n```\n\nIn this part, we tell the layout to give the transition to handle multiple property, not just single property which are the opacity, scale, and y position.\n\n## Final Result\n\n![KDE Plasma Lockscreen Modified -

Mungkin kalian kenal dengan tools bernama Rufus yang biasa dipake buat flash Windows ISO atau Unetbootin buat flash Linux-distro ISO ke dalam satu USB. Tapi di luar sana ternyata ada satu tools yg menurut gw cukup keren karena mampu nampung multiple ISO ke dalem satu eksternal device, namanya adalah Ventoy.\n\n## Now the concept\n\nOke, kita mulai dari kenapanya dulu si ventoy menurut gw cukup penting berperan dalam kehidupan gw ngegunain Linux. Gw personally make linux sebagai daily driver gw beside Windows, yup laptop gw yg sekarang ini udah ada bawaan Windows 11 Ori sebenernya, tapi gw tetep gagal move on ke windows karena udah nyaman banget make Linux.\n\nSecara pribadi gw juga kadang suka ganti distro jika dirasa ada bug/issue/problem di salah satu versi distro itu yg cukup ganggu gua (Biasany gw copy data penting ke harddisk, tinggal install ulang, copy balik lagi beres apalagi SSD udah mayan kenceng buat copy data sekarang).\n\nNah dalam beberapa kasus krusial gw pun tetep butuh live CD sebagai senjata buat jaga-jaga ni laptop kena masalah baik di Windowsnya atau di Linuxnya sendiri, dimana biasanya mereka butuh perangkat live CD buat ngerepair OSnya. Sedangkan gw ngerasa sayang untuk kapasitas Flash disk yg misal 8GB sampe 32GB cuman kepake buat satu OS doang. Jadi hadirlah Ventoy di hidup gw dengan segala kemudahannya.\n\nNah gimana sih cara si ventoy ngeflash ini dibanding dengan dengan tools kaya Rufus atau Unetbootin. Oke sejujurnya gw gak bahas sampe ke level teknis terlalu dalem karena gw disini PoVnya sebagai user biasa aja bukan org yg paham daleman si software ini bekerjanya gimana sampe ke code level. Pada dasarnya Rufus atau Unetbootin ketika ngeflash file ISO ke dalem satu perangkat eksternal yg terjadi adalah:\n\n- Dia bakal ngeformat eksternal disk tersebut\n- Buat partisi table baru di dalem disk itu\n- Ngeunpack file ISO ke dalem disk itu\n\nYang alhasil dengan konsep begini yang terjadi satu flash disk ya satu OS doang. Nah bedanya si ventoy tuh begini cara mainnya:\n\n- Dia bakal ngeformat eksternal disk tersebut\n- Buat dua partisi table:\n  - partisi pertama adalah partisi EFI (untuk boot managernya gitu lah)\n  - dan partisi kedua adalah partisi kosong\n\nNah yang menariknya si ventoy ini ada di partisi kedua yang kosong ini, di dalemnya lo bisa masukin file ISO lebih daru satu ges, Taro ISO windows? sikat, taro ISO ubuntu? sikat, taro ISO Manjaro? gaskeun. Si ventoy bakal secara otomatis ngebaca semua file ISO di partisi kedua ini di GRUB managernya ventoy ketika lo ngeboot ke flash disk itu. Dengan begini lo dapet beberapa advantage:\n\n- Selama space flash disk lo muat, harusny lu bisa naro ISO sebanyak lo mau (gw gatau ada limitasi apa enggak dr Ventoynya, mungkin agan bisa cari referensinya kalo ada info lain).\n- Lo gak perlu lagi tuh namanya format ulang, flash ulang pake rufus pake unetbootin ato pake popsicle (punyanya Pop OS), tinggal copy paste, kalo ada yg gk kepake yaudah delete, copy paste lagi ISOnya (simple kan?).\n\nNah mungkin satu kekurangan dari si ventoy ini adalah:\n\n- Partisi yang kebuat buat naro ISO ini adalah exFAT, yang mana setau gw saat ini bukan file system yg dikenali oleh Windows (CMIIW), kalo di linux seharusnya aman pasti kedetect partisinya.\n\n## Prerequisite\n\nOke sebelum eksekusi gw list dulu senjata buat ngejadiin flashdisk lo multiple live CD pake Ventoy:\n\n- Ventoy nya sendiri bisa di download di [sini](https://www.ventoy.net/en/download.html). Ventoynya sendiri kalo gw cek di sitenya cross platform harusnya pake di Linux ato Windows aman sih. ![Ventoy download page](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/mujadid-corner.appspot.com/o/storyboard_images%2F2023_11_05-Installing_Ventoy%2FVirtualBox_Linux_05_11_2023_19_57_14.jpg?alt=media)\n- File ISO yang mau lo copy, kalo mau tes beneran jadi multiple live CD saran gw ada dua ISO (misal Ubuntu sama Fedora atau sama Windows gitu). Di gua ada dua ISO:\n  - Puppy Linux - Focal Fossa (~490MB).\n  - Windows 10 Home (~5.5GB).\n- Flash disk kosong (saran gw minimal 8GB ato lebih) buat dikorbanin jadi objek percobaan.\n\n## Execution\n\nOke tinggal eksekusi aja pertama abis di download ventoynya bisa di unpack dulu pake archive manager karena filenya .tar.gz.\n\n![Extracting ventoy](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/mujadid-corner.appspot.com/o/storyboard_images%2F2023_11_05-Installing_Ventoy%2FVirtualBox_Linux_05_11_2023_20_00_52.jpg?alt=media)\n\nLanjut, abis di unpack buka terminal dulu di direktori tadi dan jalanin perintah ini.\n\n```sh\nsudo bash VentoyWeb.sh\n```\n\n![Running ventoy localhost server](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/mujadid-corner.appspot.com/o/storyboard_images%2F2023_11_05-Installing_Ventoy%2FVirtualBox_Linux_05_11_2023_20_03_38.jpg?alt=media)\n\nNah akses dah tuh url yang ada di dalem output terminal sebelumnya di dalem browser agan. Nanti muncul halaman ventoy kaya begini. Dari situ lo bisa atur jenis partisinya sesuai kebutuhan lu, di kasus gua partisinya adalah GPT.\n\n![Configuring ventoy installation](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/mujadid-corner.appspot.com/o/storyboard_images%2F2023_11_05-Installing_Ventoy%2FVirtualBox_Linux_05_11_2023_20_06_21.jpg?alt=media)\n\nTerus pastiin lo milih device yang bener ya, jangan sampe salah milih nanti salah flash bisa barabeh 🙂.\n\n![Selecting the correct installation device](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/mujadid-corner.appspot.com/o/storyboard_images%2F2023_11_05-Installing_Ventoy%2FVirtualBox_Linux_05_11_2023_20_06_28.jpg?alt=media)\n\n![Selected installation device in Ventoy](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/mujadid-corner.appspot.com/o/storyboard_images%2F2023_11_05-Installing_Ventoy%2FVirtualBox_Linux_05_11_2023_20_08_33.jpg?alt=media)\n\nKalo udah oke konfigurasinya tinggal di klik Install aja deh, nanti bakal ada dua kali konfirmasi buat mastiin aja kalo lo gk salah klik.\n\n![Ventoy installation confirmation](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/mujadid-corner.appspot.com/o/storyboard_images%2F2023_11_05-Installing_Ventoy%2FVirtualBox_Linux_05_11_2023_20_13_32.jpg?alt=media)\n\n![Ventoy installation double-check confirmation](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/mujadid-corner.appspot.com/o/storyboard_images%2F2023_11_05-Installing_Ventoy%2FVirtualBox_Linux_05_11_2023_20_13_39.jpg?alt=media)\n\nNah instalasi ini cuman instalasi wadah Ventoynya aja ges, jadi gk bakal nyampe satu menit lah installnya (di gw itungan detik udah selesai install ventoy-nya).\n\n![Installation success ventoy](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/mujadid-corner.appspot.com/o/storyboard_images%2F2023_11_05-Installing_Ventoy%2FVirtualBox_Linux_05_11_2023_20_13_46.jpg?alt=media)\n\nNah kalo udah berhasil, dari halaman webnya di panel kanan bakal muncul informasi kalo device tadi adalah device yang udah kepasang ventoy.\n\n![Ventoy-installed device](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/mujadid-corner.appspot.com/o/storyboard_images%2F2023_11_05-Installing_Ventoy%2FVirtualBox_Linux_05_11_2023_20_13_51.jpg?alt=media)\n\nNah kalo udah tinggal di close aja terminal ventoy tadi karena udah selesai tugas ventoy installernya sampe sini.\n\n![Terminate ventoy localhost server](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/mujadid-corner.appspot.com/o/storyboard_images%2F2023_11_05-Installing_Ventoy%2FVirtualBox_Linux_05_11_2023_20_14_06.jpg?alt=media)\n\nNanti lu bakal notice flashdisk lu bakal kepecah jadi dua partisi, \"VTOYEFI\" dan \"Ventoy\".
